Overlay is a browser extension helping developers evaluate open source packages before picking them.


It gathers data from various sources, including Snyk Advisor, Debricked, Openbase, Socket.dev, and Deps.dev, allowing developers to gain a better understanding of the dependencies they are using.

This is a WIP - stay tuned!
